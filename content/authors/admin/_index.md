Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Cox School of Business at SMU since August 2025.

My research interests are in corporate finance, labor economics, and entrepreneurship. One strand of my research uses administrative microdata to study how household shocks propagate to entrepreneurial firms. A second strand studies the effect of demand and technological shocks at the firm level on workersâ€™ careers and inequality. My research has been featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2024/12/02/new-study-reveals-motherhoods-toll-on-women-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>.

Before joining SMU, I was a <a href="https://www.stonefdn.org/" target="_blank">Stone</a> Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia. You can learn more about me in my {{< staticref "uploads/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}<ins>CV</ins>{{< /staticref >}}.
