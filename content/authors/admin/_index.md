I am a Stone Postdoctoral Fellow at the Vancouver School of Economics. In August 2024, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Sauder School of Business.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
My research interests include corporate finance, entrepreneurship, and labor economics. Currently, I research the effect of corporate ownership structure on workers and the determinants of entrepreneurial entry and success. I am especially interested in understanding what causes the persistent gender gap in entrepreneurship.
