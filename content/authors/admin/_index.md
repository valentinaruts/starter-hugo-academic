Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the University of British Columbia, Sauder School of Business.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
My research interests include corporate finance, entrepreneurship, and labor economics. Currently, I research the effect of corporate ownership structure on workers and the determinants of entrepreneurial entry and success. I am especially interested in understanding what causes the persistent gender gap in entrepreneurship.
