Hello! I am a <a href="https://www.stonefdn.org/wealth-inequality-centers" target="_blank">Stone</a> Postdoctoral Fellow at the Vancouver School of Economics. In August 2024, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Sauder School of Business.

I am on the 2024/2025 job market. I will attend the 2025 ASSA meeting in San Francisco.

In my research, I use administrative data to answer questions at the intersection of entrepreneurial finance and labor economics. My work has two main
strands. The first focuses on how family decisions impact entrepreneurs and their firms. The second
examines firmsâ€™ responses to economic shocks. In my job market paper, I study the effect of children on women's entrepreneurial activities. My research has been featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2024/12/02/new-study-reveals-motherhoods-toll-on-women-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>.

You can learn more about me in my {{< staticref "uploads/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}<ins>CV</ins>{{< /staticref >}}.
