Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University.
Before joining SMU, I was a <a href="https://www.stonefdn.org/" target="_blank">Stone</a> Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia.

In my research, I use administrative data to answer questions at the intersection of entrepreneurial finance and labor economics. My work has two main
strands. The first focuses on how family decisions impact entrepreneurs and their firms. The second
examines firms’ responses to economic shocks. In my job market paper, I study the effect of children on women's entrepreneurial activities. My research has been featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2024/12/02/new-study-reveals-motherhoods-toll-on-women-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>.

You can learn more about me in my {{< staticref "uploads/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}<ins>CV</ins>{{< /staticref >}}.
